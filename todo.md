 Acknowledgment Flow Design

  1. Add acknowledgment message types:
  // In sender_channel.go - after EOF
  const (
      MSG_EOF = "EOF"
      MSG_ACK = "ACK"
  )

  2. Modify receiver to send ACK after EOF:
  // In receiver_channel.go handleEOFMessage (line 167)
  func (r *ReceiverChannel) handleEOFMessage(msg webrtc.DataChannelMessage, ctx *MessageHandlerContext) {
      // Existing EOF processing...
      totalBytes, err := r.dataProcessor.FinishReceiving()
      if err != nil {
          log.Printf("Error processing EOF signal: %v", err)
          return
      }

      // Send ACK back to sender
      err = r.dataChannel.Send([]byte(MSG_ACK))
      if err != nil {
          log.Printf("Error sending ACK: %v", err)
      }

      log.Printf("File transfer complete: %d bytes received, ACK sent", totalBytes)
      // Rest of existing code...
  }

  3. Modify sender to wait for ACK:
  // In sender_channel.go sendEOFPhase (line 214)
  func (s *SenderChannel) sendEOFPhase() error {
      // Send EOF marker
      err := s.dataChannel.Send([]byte(MSG_EOF))
      if err != nil {
          return fmt.Errorf("error sending EOF: %v", err)
      }

      // Set up ACK listener before waiting
      ackReceived := make(chan bool, 1)
      s.dataChannel.OnMessage(func(msg webrtc.DataChannelMessage) {
          if string(msg.Data) == MSG_ACK {
              ackReceived <- true
          }
      })

      // Wait for ACK with timeout
      select {
      case <-ackReceived:
          log.Printf("Received ACK from receiver, closing gracefully")
      case <-time.After(10 * time.Second):
          log.Printf("ACK timeout, proceeding to close")
      case <-s.ctx.Done():
          return fmt.Errorf("cancelled while waiting for ACK: %v", s.ctx.Err())
      }

      // Now safe to close
      err = s.dataChannel.GracefulClose()
      if err != nil {
          return fmt.Errorf("error closing channel: %v", err)
      }

      return nil
  }

  Benefits:
  - Ensures receiver processed all data before sender closes
  - Timeout prevents hanging on network issues
  - Maintains data integrity for file transfers
  - Minimal overhead (single ACK message)


WebRTC handles connection reestablishment through several mechanisms designed to maintain connectivity when network conditions change:
ICE Restart
The primary mechanism is ICE restart, which allows peers to renegotiate the connection without starting completely over. When a connection fails or degrades:

Either peer can trigger an ICE restart by calling restartIce() on the RTCPeerConnection
This generates new ICE credentials and begins gathering fresh candidate pairs
The peers exchange new offer/answer with updated ICE parameters
Existing media streams continue during the restart process

Connection State Monitoring
WebRTC provides several connection state indicators:

ICE Connection State: Tracks the ICE agent's connectivity (new, checking, connected, completed, failed, disconnected, closed)
Connection State: Higher-level state combining ICE and DTLS status
Gathering State: Shows ICE candidate collection progress

Applications monitor these states and trigger reconnection when they detect failed or disconnected states.
STUN/TURN Keepalives
WebRTC maintains connections through:

STUN binding requests sent periodically to keep NAT mappings alive
TURN channel bindings refreshed to maintain relay connections
Configurable keepalive intervals (typically 15-30 seconds)

Automatic Recovery
Modern WebRTC implementations include automatic recovery features:

Continuous gathering: Some browsers continue collecting ICE candidates even after connection establishment
Candidate pair monitoring: Failed pairs are detected and replaced with working alternatives
DTLS retransmission: Handles packet loss during the handshake phase

The key advantage is that media can often continue flowing on working candidate pairs while the connection reestablishes failed paths in the background, providing a more seamless user experience than completely restarting the connection.
